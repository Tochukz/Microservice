#  Microservices using NestJS
[NestJS Microservices](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/basics)  

__Overview__  
In Nest, a microservice is fundamentally an application that uses a different transport layer than HTTP.  
Most transporters natively support both _request-response_ and _event-based_ message styles.
Nest abstracts the implementation details of each transporter behind a canonical interface for both request-response and event-based messaging.
